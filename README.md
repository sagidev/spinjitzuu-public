## IMPORANT INFO

OPEN SOURCE SPINJITZUU VERSION IS QUITTED. I WONT ANSWER ON ANY QUESTIONS RELATED TO THIS ONE. CURRENT ACTIVE SPINJITZUU VERSION CAN BE FOUND ON https://spinjitzuu.lol/ . 
I don't upload any binaries. This source is just a "decent" base to learn from. As i coded it at the start of my learning journey, many parts of the code can be bad and not optimized. Many things can not work anymore as well, but the whole idea of how it work will not change.

# Spinjitzuu External Orbwalker

An advanced League of Legends Orbwalker with Target Selector. I finally pushed it to public to improve the code and to stop people from buying wadbot for 30$/month for such an easy piece of code.
This script is **fully external**, so it doesn't inject into your game. It just hooks your mouse and keyboard and read necessary info from the screen.
