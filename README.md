# Spinjitzuu External Orbwalker

An advanced League of Legends Orbwalker with Target Selector. I finally pushed it to public to improve the code and to stop people from buying wadbot for 30$/month for such an easy piece of code.
This script is **fully external**, so it doesn't inject into your game. It just hooks your mouse and keyboard and read necessary info from the screen.
